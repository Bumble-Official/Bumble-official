                              I have Audhd and a few other things I'm not willing to share fully.
                          I may come off as standoffish, as I'm quiet unless spoken to first normally.
                                                I use tone tags occasinally-

                I block and hide freely! Don't get upset, I have my reasons. Though, I do try to be patient with people.
                    Please don't cover me, or copy my skins! I work hard on them and would like to see them!!‚ö†Ô∏é

                                      You can find me by the bakery archways the most.
